# 📄🔍 Plagiarism Checker using TF-IDF in Python

This project detects textual similarity between multiple student notes using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity**, helping identify possible cases of plagiarism.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically reads `.txt` files from a folder
- Uses **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to vectorize the text
- Computes **cosine similarity** between each pair of documents
- Flags pairs with high similarity as potentially plagiarized

---

## 🧱 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- scikit-learn
- numpy

You can install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy
